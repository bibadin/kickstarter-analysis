### A challenge I encountered was entering =COUNTIF rather than =COUNTIFS which limits how many sets of data can be entered at a time. After receiving an error message multiple times I reviewed the overall formula to see that the "S" was missing and then made all the difference in obtaining the correct value.
## Results
### The theater outcomes based on launch date show that plays are most successful April through August with an overall peak in May while canceled and failed plays remained relatively consistent all year.
### The theater outcomes based on goals showed more failed plays especially 45,000 to 49,999 goals.
### The limitations seen where that sample of projects with goals >= 10,000 were far fewer compared to projects with cheaper goals.
### A bar chart and pie chart could have also been created to visualized
